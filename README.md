[Isolario](https://isolario.it/) is a project aimed to observe, collect and analyse real-time Internet routing data. The _Visolario_ project is a collaboration between Isolario and the WAFI research group of the Institute of Informatics and Telematics of the CNR in Pisa focused on finding visual representations suited for the visualization of the Autonomous System (AS) topology and the BGP routing data.

This repository documents how data coming from the [Isolario project](https://isolario.it/) has to be properly pre-processed in order to be visualized.

The [transform script](transform.py) takes as input three files:
- [tier1.txt](input/tier1.txt) contains the list of AS numbers belonging to the [Tier1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network);
- [links.csv](input/links.csv) defines relationships between ASes (file produced by Isolario);
- [as_details.json](input/as_details.json) contains all the information about ASes (file produced by Isolario).
